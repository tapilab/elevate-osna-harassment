Mainly Use：
LogisticRegression, MLPClassifier，RandomForestClassifier and Tensorflow.

Different methods have its own characteristics:
Logisticregression: Dichotomy, binary trees.
MLPClassifier: Using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent.
RandomForestClassifier: 'Combine' improve precision and avoid overfitting.
Tensorflow: More complex, but effctive.
